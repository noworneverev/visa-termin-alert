# visa-termin-alert

## About The Project
The project is inspired by a terminated chatbot service which is aimed at providing instant German visa appointments status. As you may know, it is extremely difficult to book a appointment to apply German visa in Taiwan in busy season, one may have to refresh the termin page ALL DAY LONG FOR SEVERAL DAYS to reserve a seat. Since the German Institue don't tell us when vacant appointments will be released exactly, I built this chatbot to notify those who want to arrange appointments.

## Operating Period
From May to October every year.

## Closed Source
To prevent abusing the script, I decided not to open source at this moment. Well, for those who are able to book a position using scripts, I hope that you only do it for yourself, not for business purpose.

All scripts above are trivial, `clock.py` and `Procfile` were used for Heroku deployment, however, Heroku plans to shutdown all free services, so I migrate the cron job to other cloud service provider, that took me a quite while.
